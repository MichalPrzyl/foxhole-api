# Foxhole - front visualisator
Foxhole is a game. People are fighting as a fraction with other fractions. The key is the communication, logistics and teamwork.

I created that visualisator just for fun. I haven't even played the game.
It has public API that provides data about current (in-game) war, and I wanted to mess around with
quick FastAPI and JS.

# TODOS
- add grid lines
- add segments
- add icons to objects so they would be more recognicable by players
- add automatic api shoot
- store results in mongoDB
- apply animations for latest data, so the user would instantly know how front is moving
- add some kind of control over which map we are currently looking at (I HAVE TO PLAY THE GAME FIRST :P )
